# Tropical-Rainforest-and-Monsoon
Tropical climates are denoted with the letter A. This repository contains images for the tropical rainforest AF and tropical monsoon AM climates.

The other types of climates are in the following repositories:

Tropical Savannah https://github.com/DRCA2020/Tropical-Savannah
Arid Climates https://github.com/DRCA2020/Arid
Temperate Climates https://github.com/DRCA2020/Temperate
Cold Climates https://github.com/DRCA2020/Cold
Polar Tundra https://github.com/DRCA2020/Polar

The images of the dataset are divided by their main weather, in the case of the Tropical Climate the division was made because of the amount of images.
The codes of the climates are those from the KÃ¶ppen-Geiger classification.

The Water Body and Climate Codes file contains the names of each water body, bays are named as such, otherwise if the type of body is not pointed out, the images belong to a river and its delta.
